Time efficiency/complexity - FAST
Space efficiency/complexity - MEMORY

//add 2 ints
int x,y,z; //int is about 32 bit, unsigned


z=x+y;
    //This is actually involoves load, add, store
    //load(k), add(k), store(k)
    //These are all constants. 
    //if 32 bits + 32 bits -> return the same type


32 bits OS u - 4GB
    You can't get tp use real 4 gb, because you can only contains to the max 32

"GRADE SCHOOL METHOD"
Carry, x, y

S(n) = n + n+ n+1 + 1
the time complexity, take k times to add the column. 
T(n) = Kn, so it's linear

HW:
    Program the grade school multiplication
    //2 hours
    - Check time and space complexity
